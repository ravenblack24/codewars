## General info
These solutions were written using the challenge descriptions, and verified against test cases, documented on https://www.codewars.com/.  

Codewars is a community of developers, called Code Warriors, that train on improving their development skills. Think of it like a coding dojo - where developers train with each other and help each other get better through practice.

The original test cases used to validate the solutions are included within the comment at the top of each file for reference. 

## Technologies
* Vanilla Javascript including ES6

## Setup
Code within these files can be copied and pasted into a JS console.   

## Status
Project is on hold as I work on learning other aspects of web development.
